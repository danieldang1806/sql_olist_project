# Olist E-commerce: A customer analysis
<br>

**Database**: <br>
This notebook uses most of tables in the Olist database from `customers` table to `orders`, `order_items`, `products` and `sellers` <br><br>

**Flow of analysis**: <br>
- Time series analysis with metrics such as customer growth rate and repeat customer rate
- Where are Olist's customers? What insights can we get from the location of customers? <br><br>

**Overview of conclusion**:<br>
- The performance of Olist was good in 2017 and 2018 with a high growth rate in both number of overall customers and repeat customers. Though the growth rate of repeat customers was increasing at a faster pace than the rate of overall customers, the number of repeat customers only accounted for a very small amount of all customers Olist had.
- As we could expect, most customers of Olist came from biggest cities of Brazil like Sao Paulo, which was the biggest market of Olist based on revenue.
- Despite of that title, the average revenue per order and per customers in this city were much lower than its counterpart in Brazil.
Customers tend to purchase products from outside their cities. And regardless of location, health beauty, furnitures and sports leisure were the most popular product categories based on the number of orders.
